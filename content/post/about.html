<p><em>Personal History</em>: I grew up in sunny Jupiter, FL but was born outside of Philadelphia. I was lucky enough to get a chance to study at the UPenn for my undergraduate education, then moved to Seattle for a few years
to work for a botique food/beverage consultancy. My love for data analysis was rekindled there, and, having had enough of the rain, I decided to pursue a PhD in Statistics in Fort Collins, CO.</p>
<p><em>Hobbies</em>: I’m an unreformed data junkie with a love for elegant graphics and geometric presentations. When I’m not geeking out, I like knitting,
acting in plays, and valiantly attempting to keep houseplants alive.</p>
