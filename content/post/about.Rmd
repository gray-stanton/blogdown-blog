Hello! I'm Gray Stanton, a market researcher and data analyst who currently lives in Seattle. Specifically, I work in the food and beverage space,
crunching data on what people eat in order to identify food trends. 

I'm an unreformed data junkie with a love for elegant graphics and geometric presentations. When I'm not geeking out, I like knitting, 
acting in plays, and valiantly attempting to keep houseplants alive.
