Note to future self: this is so far the best way I've figured out to make changes on this blog.

Any Rmarkdown files/blog posts should be put in the content/post folder. Blogdown will run its custom hugo build to get that to be a 
html file. If the post should be rendered with a different pandoc/hugo/output format, put it in static/post, which will render using whatever
document format is specified in the YAML preamble.

You need to run blogdown::build_site() in order to render changes in the Rmd to html. Then, commit it to the git repo and push it to github.
Netlify will take care of the rest.

To add images or pdfs, put them in the static/images or static/pdf folder, which can then be linked to from the site directly. As above, if you
have a Rmd file which you want to render to pdf instead of html say, put that in the static/post folder, assuming the output format is set in the 
file.

Useful things to adjust are: 

themes/hyde/index.html - to change how posts and such are displayed on the main page.

themes/hyde/partials/sidebar.html - to change what goes in the sidebar.

themes/hyde/static/css/hyde.css - how to change the styling of the blog overall.

Don't bother touching anyting in public/ as thats all dynamically generated.
